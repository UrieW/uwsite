# About Me  

When I was born, I had a lot of dreams, and my mind was open to a lot
of things...  

Sounds simple?  

I think not. After dabbling in enough worldly and monster affairs,
I've decided to do something about it. I've used plan after plan to
bring a network of products to full focus. Pyramid dreams it might,
but I'm very sure that I've nerfed the most beautiful dreams ever 
known to man!!!!  

This was all done to fulfill a prophecy, while(and it's legit!!!)
keeping a few things on the side, so I'll always be remembered as
a true friend to the end...  

## My Traits  

I'm usually watchful, with a chill and jokery side kept between me
and my peers at all times, and when I'm not, it's usually where
sadness, anger and anxiety takes control, before I find the joys
of finding the triggers of each and stopping them, while 
learning more about the truth. And I'm not perfect, either.
