# An Only Urie W Site Shop Terms and Conditions("Agreement")

## ***This Agreement was last modified on March 1, 2025.***

## Privacy Policy

The buyer's info, such as identity info, location and payment methods will 
be used to fulfill every transaction in the shop, made by the buyer, at 
point of sale, at all times, nonetheless. Complaints can be still made to 
the seller, however, in an attempt to stop potential fraud, accidental, or 
otherwise.

## Payment


All payments are due upon receipt. If a payment is not received or payment 
method is declined, the buyer forfeits the ownership of any items 
purchased. If no payment is received, no items will be shipped. 


## Shipping Policies


Shipping will be paid for by the buyer in the amount agreed upon by the 
seller at the time of purchase. If an item is lost during shipping, the 
total cost of item, including shipping, will be refunded to the buyer by 
the seller. Shipping costs may double if shipping internationally. If an 
item is damaged during shipping, seller will not be held responsible.


## Refund/Return Policy


Some items(shirts, games, DVDs, etc,...) are entitled to be refunded or 
returned based on complaint. No books can be returned or refunded, 
whatsoever. However, if an item is damaged during shipping, a replacement 
item will be sent free of charge. If an item is unsatisfactory, a written 
explanation is needed before the item may be considered for a refund. 
Buyer must take into account the description of the item before 
requesting a refund. If the item matches the description by the seller 
and the buyer is unsatisfied, seller is not responsible for refund. 
Exchanges are granted on a case-by-case basis.


## Cancellation


An item may be cancelled up until payment has been processed. Once 
payment has been processed, the buyer is responsible for payment. 


## Complaints


Any complaints about items or sellers may be sent to our support 
team: offuriew@gmail.com or (630) 414-5362. There is no guarantee 
of a resolution. Each case will be looked at individually, and the 
seller will be in contact as well.


## Legalities


The seller is not responsible for any health or safety concerns 
once the buyer has received the item. If any harm is incurred from 
the items purchased by the buyer, the seller shares no 
responsibility. 


These terms and conditions are subject to change.


I have read and agree to the terms and conditions.
