## Status Report(Feb 22, 2025):

The guide pages' link error was fully made by the webdev's problem knowing
how to link pages server-wise. The error has been fully fixed, and all pages
affected in the first place have been updated to show the fix!!!

Thank you for waiting, and have a very safe weekend!!!!!
