# Status Report  

Ladies and gentlemen, there's been an error with linking the guide pages
in the 'Guides' and latest guide update pages. Until it's fixed, I'll
be working with my tools and forum accounts on the issue.

However, it has come to attention that the linked pages can be found on the site via the tags and categories found on the site.

And there will be more content in the future. Have a safe, new year!!!
